# Random-Story-Generator---JS
This project is based on the MDN's Frontend program. The code listens for the click in order to generate a random story.

Thanks to this assesment I was able to understand the logic behind a program and the way the language is used to retrieve and transform information and data the exact way it is needed in order to create the expeceted result. In this specific case, the task was to complete the code (define variables and call methods to access the arrays that contain the random element sto be inserted in our story) and look for possible errors. 

I also wanted to play with the arrays so I could get more creative and create more strings for the output to display. I will add a bit more of it, since I also changed the "UK" label to "MX" thinking about making the measures equivalent to MexicoÂ´s (Kilograms and Celsisus). Although this was a pure Javascript focused project, I also made a few changes to the CSS so it would end up looking a bit more like my own style.

Having an option to have an english and spanish version is also something Im interested in, I will be taking it into account for next versions, assesments or tutorials.
